# 📚 Binary Search Tree Delete Operation in Java

A Java console application developed by **Chamod Lakshitha** that demonstrates the implementation of the **delete operation in a Binary Search Tree (BST)**.  
This project covers deletion cases for nodes with no children, one child, and two children, maintaining the BST properties throughout.

## ✨ Features

- 🔹 **Node Class**: Represents each node in the BST.
- 🔹 **BinaryTree Class**: Implements insertion, deletion, and in-order traversal.
- 🔹 **Delete Method**: Handles all three deletion cases:
  - Node with no children (leaf node).
  - Node with one child.
  - Node with two children using inorder successor.
- 🔹 **MVC Architecture**: Clear separation of Model, View, and Controller for clean code organization.
- 🔹 **Main Class**: Demonstrates the BST operations with example insertions and deletions.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/JAVA-Binary-Tree-Deletion.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

    ```bash
    cd JAVA-Binary-Tree-Deletion
    ```

3. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java IDE.

4. Run the `Main.java` class to see insertions, deletions, and in-order traversals demonstrated in the console.

## 📝 Explanation of Delete Cases

- **Case 1:** Delete a leaf node by removing it directly.
- **Case 2:** Delete a node with one child by linking its parent directly to the child.
- **Case 3:** Delete a node with two children by replacing it with its inorder successor and deleting the successor node.
